FILE: app.py

TECH STACK USED:
- Python
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- PIL (for image processing)
- Scikit-learn (for text vectorization and similarity calculation)
- Base64 (for encoding and decoding)
- IO (for input/output operations)

WORKING / LOGIC SUMMARY:
- The application is a plagiarism checker that compares the similarity between two text files.
- It uses the TF-IDF vectorizer to convert text into numerical vectors and calculates the cosine similarity between the vectors.
- The application has a GUI with two panels: one for file selection and controls, and another for displaying the analysis results.
- The user can select two text files, and the application will calculate and display the similarity score between them.

IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS:
- `vectorize(Text)`: converts text into numerical vectors using TF-IDF vectorizer
- `similarity(doc1, doc2)`: calculates the cosine similarity between two vectors
- `check_plagiarism(file1, file2)`: calculates the similarity score between two text files
- `analyze_plagiarism()`: analyzes the plagiarism between two selected files and displays the results
- `upload_files()`: opens a file dialog for the user to select two text files
- `update_file_display(file_paths)`: updates the file display area with the selected file information

IMPORTANT CLASSES:
- `ModernButton`: a custom button class with a modern design
- `FileDropArea`: a custom file drop area class that allows users to drag and drop files
- `ResultGauge`: a custom gauge class that displays the similarity score visually

ENDPOINTS (if any):
| Method | Route | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None | None | This is a desktop application and does not have any endpoints |

NOTES:
- The application uses a simple and intuitive GUI to make it easy for users to select files and view the analysis results.
- The application uses a gauge to visually represent the similarity score, making it easy to understand the results at a glance.
- The application provides a step-by-step guide on how to use it, making it easy for new users to get started.

FILE: README.md

TECH STACK USED:
- Python
- scikit-learn

WORKING / LOGIC SUMMARY:
- The script performs plagiarism detection on a set of text documents using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) approach and calculates the cosine similarity between pairs of documents.

IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS:
- TF-IDF vectorization: uses scikit-learn's TF-IDF vectorizer to convert text into numerical vectors
- Cosine similarity calculation: calculates the cosine similarity between each pair of documents to identify potential plagiarism

IMPORTANT CLASSES:
- None explicitly mentioned, but utilizes scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer and cosine_similarity functions

ENDPOINTS (if any):
| None, as this is a script and not a web application |

NOTES:
- Requires scikit-learn library to be installed
- Outputs pairs of documents along with their cosine similarity scores, indicating potential plagiarism
